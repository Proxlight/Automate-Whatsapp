# 😊 Automate Whatsapp Messages Using Python

Hi everyone👋,Python is probably one of the coolest languages. And the fascinating about it is that you can automate day-to-day tasks.

One such task we do every day is sending messages on WhatsApp.

Although this task is as simple as picking up the phone, typing, and tapping on the “send” button, but we sometimes forget to send a wishing message on special occasions like birthdays, anniversaries, etc.

So you must be wondering can we schedule a WhatsApp message?

Definitely, you can by using a library called pywhatkit. We can schedule messages to send to any of our contacts or to a group.

You can refer to our YouTube video to see a working tutorial for a better understanding and a step-by-step guide of the same.
